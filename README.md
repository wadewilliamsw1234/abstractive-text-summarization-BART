## Abstractive Summarization

This project implements an abstractive text summarization model leveraging the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) architecture. BART is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model designed to generate concise, coherent summaries that capture the essence of input text by paraphrasing rather than merely extracting sentences. This repository fine-tunes BART on a dataset and use it for summarization tasks.
